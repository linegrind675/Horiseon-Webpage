# Module-1-Challenge

### Horiseon Webpage

* The task at hand was to fix a given code that has a few functioning issues.

* Some formatting was also changed throughout the style document.

###### Work Done

* In the index.html file, the "search-engine-optimization" class was given an ID element,  to complete the link to the site itself.

* For multiple CSS style classes, there was too much repeated code.  In order to minimize the code shown, I needed to consolidate each similar styling elements to the matching class.  As commented in the style document.

* All changes were applied and pushed to the repository.
